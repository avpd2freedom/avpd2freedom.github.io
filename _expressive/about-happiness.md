I can be so much better than I am. It's that feeling of positive motivation, knowing that I should be at peace with what I have because there will never be anything that makes me say, "I've got it! I'm already happy!"

It's optimism, it's enthusiasm, it's being in a struggle to achieve things, it's an acceptance of knowing that I have things to improve but without pressure, it's trusting that I will succeed, because yes, it's a choice, and it's the choice I make. It's loving the process, it sounds clich√©, but that's how it is, the process is all we have left.

It's like the carrot and the stick, *you'll never reach happiness if you chase it, inherently this means you're not happy because you're chasing something, but happiness is not something you attain by seeking it in something, so inherently, by this rule, you will never be happy.*
