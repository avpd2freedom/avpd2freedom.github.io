I've been feeling like I've been trapped in a deep well for several years now, and it seems like I can't find my way out. Sometimes, I catch a glimpse of the light, but strangely enough, I often take it upon myself to snuff it out. It's this persistent emptiness, a nagging feeling that something is missing. If you were to ask me, I'd openly admit that I'm not content, that something is amiss.

My primary challenges revolve around social connections and a wavering self-esteem. It's been a while since I've shared a meaningful connection with a woman. I've been confined to my own world for quite some time, distrusting people and avoiding life experiences due to some irrational fear that lingers within me. I've allowed myself to believe that I'm ineffectual, but now I recognize the need to break free from that mindset. As I've mentioned, I'm not here to wallow in self-pity any longer.

One of the detrimental habits I've developed is fapping. It drains an excessive amount of my energy, and I struggle to rein it in. When you attempt to break free from it and find yourself unable to do so, it becomes a real challenge, much like any other obstacle in life. I'm not saying I want to eliminate it entirely, forever and always; I'm uncertain if that's even feasible or realistic. However, I do aspire to achieve some streaks of abstinence—5 days, 10 days, 30 days—and regain control over it. Moreover, it's not just about that; what I genuinely yearn for is to rid myself of this overwhelming, hypersexualized content that bombards me from various platforms incessantly. I want to eliminate that, the time-suck, and feel like I'm gaining something. That's the essence of it, the sense of gaining. Furthermore, it has numerous adverse effects, such as hindering my ability to foster healthy relationships with women, as it's readily accessible at all hours from the comfort of my home. This doesn't align with the person I aspire to be, and I'm determined to demonstrate that.

One of the most positive changes I've made is hitting the gym. I've gained nearly 20 kilograms in two years, and I could argue that I now have a decent physique. Currently, I weigh 62 kilograms (yes, I was quite thin). Initially, I embarked on this journey with the aim of attracting women. However, it evolved into a test of discipline, something I find myself lacking these days. I ventured into the world of Tinder, and to be honest, I had numerous matches. Yet, this irrational fear, coupled with my low self-esteem, lack of confidence, and persistent negative habits, hinders my progress in relationships. I acknowledge that there's much to learn.

Life is indeed marvelous. Deep down, I know this to be true. However, presently, I'm unable to fully grasp it or feel that burning passion for living that I've experienced in the past. My mental serenity is nonexistent, and I've neglected practices like mindfulness and emotional management. I do read extensively, that's for certain, and I plan to share what I learn through this blog. I've gleaned a wealth of knowledge from my readings, but I sense a deficit of action. Despite sporadic moments of taking action, they've been far too infrequent. In part, this blog serves as a means to motivate myself to acquire knowledge and take tangible steps forward. I need to ponder the specifics of how to achieve this. During moments of clarity, I've felt that I've made substantial progress and acknowledged that there's much more to learn, many more actions to take. In comparison to previous years, I can see that progress has been made.

Professionally, I'm not doing poorly, although I'm tied to a fixed salary. I work as a programmer, and I thoroughly enjoy creating things. What I aim to achieve is freedom from external dictates, to have the autonomy to decide what I wear, where I live, and when I work.

It's an audacious goal, but why settle for anything less? Would I wake up with a renewed sense of purpose each morning? That's precisely why I've embarked on this blog. It will serve as a record of my journey towards freedom and mastery, documenting how I attained it. It will remain my little secret. avpd2freedom.
