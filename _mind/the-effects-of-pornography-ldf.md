Consuming porn and masturbating make you enjoy things less.

We release dopamine when we feel the reward is near (the architect), then another release happens, which is the pawn executing and making the desire to do that increase, creating a habit. Another thing is also released (CREB) that makes the dopamine receptor limit desire increase over time, meaning it becomes harder for us to release dopamine and increase desire, which is why we seek more extravagant ways to generate a greater reward and desire, with more intensity.

This makes small things like taking a walk, a hug, having coffee, or meeting people not appeal to us as much.

In fact, it makes us focus solely on the act because it's what generates the greatest reward and desire. We forget about the other things like going out into the real world, getting to know someone, talking, etc., and then naturally engaging in the act. These preceding moments can create insecurities, which is why we don't like them. Pornography, on the other hand, doesn't judge us. Why bother improving myself when porn is enough?

In reality, I'm destroying myself every day. **Trying to improve while continuing to masturbate compulsively is like trying to heat a house in the middle of a blizzard with all the windows wide open.**
