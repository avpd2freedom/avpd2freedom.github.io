The first challenge was a success. After achieving it, I've gone back to masturbating (twice, actually), and it's normal; I know that counting the days of no fapping isn't the right approach. But I want to try something; I want to achieve another streak after a relapse because right now is when I think that what I've set up is pointless, that the blog won't help me at all. **I'm going to prove otherwise**. After a relapse, I'm generally unable to go more than a day or two without fapping.

2nd challenge: 3 days. I'll test my determination in a tough case. I'll update soon.
