**Objective**: I'm aiming to bulk up to 70 kg; currently, I weigh 62 kg. My physique isn't bad; I've been seriously training for a little over two years. I'm not entirely defined because recently, I've attempted unsuccessful bulking phases where I neither lost nor gained weight. My abs are visible, but I'm far from being well-defined.

**Training Program**: Up until now, I've been following a 4-day program: Chest + Triceps, Back + Biceps, Legs, and Shoulders + Biceps. This week will be somewhat transitional towards a 6-day split, and it should be fully implemented next week. I have a training partner, which makes it enjoyable and productive.

**Weekly Goal**: Nearly 63 kg.

**Monthly Goal**: 64 kg.

**Nutrition**: My nutritional approach is rather straightforward, targeting around **3100 calories** daily. When I do martial arts I need a bit more.

- **Breakfast**: Morning shake with whole milk, peanut butter, 60g of muesli, and a banana. This totals around 1000 calories.

- **Meals**: I typically receive meals with a minimum of 700 calories each. I don't live with my parents, which helps me eat balanced meals and meet my calorie goals. I often find it difficult to eat, so I often resort to shakes and consume milk.

- **Snack**: 7-8 slices of cheese or 30g of hazelnuts, along with milk, which adds up to about 400 calories.

- **After Each Meal**: I add another 300 calories with Serious Mass Optimum Nutrition + milk to drink it. So, I've already consumed about 2700 calories by this point.

- **Dinner**: With dinner, I reach the minimum of 3100 calories. Dinners can be a four-egg omelet with two cans of tuna and slices of cheese, turkey filets (usually in burger form), white wine sausages, or smoked salmon. On weekends, I might order delivery on some nights.

One crucial step is having the morning shake; if I skip it or have it late, my nutrition for the day falls apart.

What works for one person might seem trivial to others. This approach works for me, and I find it easy to consume based on my characteristics. I ensure I get the protein I need. There's a lot of trial and error involved. I'll continue updating on my progress and new goals every week.
